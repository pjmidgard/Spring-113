Algorithm Spring-113:

Need to try to predict 0000-1111 except 
01XX-10XX. Need to find string if cell 
equal 0 save as 01 String containing bits. 
String need to move in X value -1: and :-1
string need to move of block back -1 and 
front -1 e.g.: 000001001111-111100000100,
if we find on the string 01, save where:
0 if end if file times compress else 1 
and where it that on top. Save 6 bits and 
long of zeros long (2**63)-1. String  move 
and there are exist "01" on the cell 1 need to write where
it is. times  of compression.Blocks long need increase from 
16 bits-while increase size of block compare 
size of file.Save Times of times of compression.
Add 1 on the start and 0-7 zeros. Binary file 
format .bin.
