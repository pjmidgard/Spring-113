Algorithm Spring-113:

Need to try to predict "0000-1111" except "01XX-10XX". Need to find string if cell equal 0 save. if we find on the string "01", save where: "0" if end if file times compress else "1" and where it that on top. Save 6 bits and long of zeros long (2**63)-1. if block not compress, times of compression. Blocks long need increase from //8 bits-while increase size of block compare size of file. Save how many long bits of compression block, not compression block Add 1. Save Times of times of compression. Add 1 on the start and 0-7 zeros. Binary file format .bin.
